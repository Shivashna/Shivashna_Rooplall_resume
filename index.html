			<p id = "AM1">My name is Shivashna Rooplall and I am an enthusiastic young woman who has a passion for modern technology. I am currently enrolled in a Software Engineering 
			Bootcamp at Hyperion Development and I am also a first year Computer Science Student at the University of South Africa. My journey began with with an academic career in 
			Electrical Engineering which equipped me with the knowledge to understand electrical systems, as well as skills in programming  and architectural drawing.</p>

			<p id = "AM2">My passion for programming since high school is what inspired me to embark on this adventure towards becoming a successful software engineer. To me, programming 
			isn't just about writing quality code, it's also about the experience that your users attain from using your code.  </p>

			<p id = "AM3">I am ecstatic about programming as it ignites my creative mind, it challenges me to think out-of-the-box and it allows me to showcase my problem-solving skills.
			My objective as a future software engineer is to create efficient, logical and innovative systems that can better the lives of the people who use them.</p>

		<ol>
			<li> <b>Financial Calculator : </b> This is a simple program that allows the user to access two different financial calculators, namely, an investment 
			calculator and a home loan repayment calculator. This program is appropriate for small financial companies and can be used by clients to calculate the 
			amount they could earn from an investment or how much they would have to pay on a home loan monthly. This program is written in the Python Language.</li>
		
			<br>
		
			<li> <b>Simple PyGame : </b> This project is a simple game created using Pygame, which is a library of code that allows you to create simple games
			using Python programming. The game consists of 1 player object, 3 enemy objects and 1 prize object. This game is suitable for younger children between 
			the ages of 5 to 12 years as it would be way too simple for teenagers to play.</li>
		
			<br>
		
			<li> <b>Task Manager : </b> This program is designed to help small businesses manage tasks assigned to each member of their team. This project is useful 
			as it would allow small business owners to keep track of their employees and the progress of the business as well. This program is written in the Python
			language.</li>
		
			<br>
		
			<li> <b>Project Management System : </b> This program is written in the Java Language and is a project management system for a small structural engineering 
			firm.This program allows the user to create a new project by allowing them to enter all the details for the project itself and the details for all the people 
			involved with the project such as the client, contractor and architect. It also allows the user to edit certain details of the project. This program can be 
			used by any construction company or other structural engineering firms and can be modified to meet their requirements.</li>
		
			<br>
		
			<li> <b>Enhanced Project Management System : </b> This program is written in the Java programming language. The purpose of this project management 
			system is to enhance the previous 'Poised' project by incorporating database programming into the system. This program allows the user to create a new 
			project by allowing them to enter all the details for the project itself and the details for all the people involved with the project such as the client, 
			contractor and architect. This program can be used by any construction company or other structural engineering firms and can be modified to meet their 
			requirements. Please note that this program makes use of object-oriented programming.</li>
